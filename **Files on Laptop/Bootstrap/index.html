			<p>There are fewer than 25,000 polar bears left in the wild, according to the nonprofit organization Polar Bears International. Near the southern Beaufort Sea, for instance, the population has dropped about 40 percent between 2001 to 2010, from 1,500 to 900 bears.</p>

		<h1>The Challenges Faced by Polar Bears</h1>
		<h3>Polar bears are in danger because...</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Annual ice-free periods, which may last up to 5 months by 2050, prevent polar bears from being able to hunt,</li>
			<li>Warmer temperatures increase the spread of disease among polar bears,</li>
			<li>Pollution, human encroachment, and resource (oil) exploitation are at peak levels,</li>
			<li>Polar bears are forced south towards Canada and human contact because of melting ice,</li>
			<li>Polar bear hunting hasn't yet been outlawed in Greenland, where bear skins are prized,</li>
			<li>Seals, which are their typical prey, are dying out as well, so polar bears are forced to eat unusual food (even human food), and</li>
			<li>Global warming is continuing to eat away at their habitats.</li>
